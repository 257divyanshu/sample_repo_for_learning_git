git config --global --unset core.pager
- to rollback to the old configuration, which used pager for logs

git config --global core.pager cat
- for configuring git to never use pager for logs

what does pager mean in the current context
- in Git (and Unix-like systems), a pager is a program that displays text one screen at a time, allowing you to scroll through long outputs instead of having everything printed at once.
- This helps when the output is long and doesnâ€™t fit on one screen.
- The pager waits for user input, which is why Git Bash seems "stuck" at (END).

git --no-page log
- displays the summary without a pager

git log --online
- displays the summary in one line

git log -n 5
- will display the data about previous 5 commits

git log
- displays the data about previous commits

git remote add origin "url"
- to add a remote repository to your local git repository

git remote -v
- to check remote repositories linked to our local git repository

git rm --cached <file>
- removes a file from the staging area, but keeps it in the working area
- the file becomes untracked (git will ignore it in future commits)
- useful when you accidentally added a file and want to remove it from tracking without deleting it

git restore --staged <file>
- to unstage a staged file

git restore <file>
- restores changes in the working directory from the last committed version
- does not affect the staging area (unless --staged is used)
- does not remove the file from git tracking
